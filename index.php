<p>I am currently enrolled and on track to earn my AAS (Associates in Applied Science) degree from Seattle Central College. I am professionally trained in a wide range of design, development, and office management computer software and systems like; the complete Adobe Creative Suite, Github, Microsoft 360, Excel, Access, and many other applications on both macOS, and Microsoft.</p>

<p> My expertise is in responsive website development and design, including integrating iOT devices and machine learning syntax and shell script code to create an accessible environment for building business infrastructure, tools, and applications.</p>

<p>Most of my projects are in the process of being developed as I continue my education at Seattle Central College, in there IT program. The learning environment at Seattle Central has allowed me to utilize the newest in Chrome Developer Tools, Googles Cloud Technology applications, remote communications software and much more. </p>
